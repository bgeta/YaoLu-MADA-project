  abstract  = "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic,
               which affected around 45 million confirmed cases of COVID-19,
               including more than 6 million deaths. However, on November 24,
               2021, the World Health Organization announced a new severe acute
               respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variant designated as the
               B.1.1.529, a variant of concern (VOC), and the variant has been
               named as ``Omicron.'' Available preliminary evidence suggests
               that, as compared with previous VOCs, it has an increased risk
               of infectivity. Studies have shown that protection from various
               vaccines effectiveness against hospitalization and death from
               severe COVID-19 disease is decreasing slowly after a two-dose
               schedule of COVID-19 vaccines. In response to experiencing a new
               COVID-19 variant and ongoing resurgence of cases, the importance
               of COVID-19 vaccine booster dose and durability of the effect of
               the third dose of vaccine against COVID-19 Omicron variant is
               controversial yet. To address this, we conducted a systematic
               literature survey on effectiveness of the third or booster dose
               of COVID-19 vaccine against the Omicron variant. We have
               performed a systematic search in PubMed (Medline), Google
               Scholar, and MedRXiv database, from inception to January 2022
               using the MeSH terms and keywords ``Corona Virus Disease-2019 OR
               COVID-19 AND Omicron AND COVID-19 Booster Vaccine.'' We have
               identified a total of 27 published studies. We have reviewed all
               the eligible available studies on the effectiveness of the
               COVID-19 vaccine booster shots against the Omicron variant. This
               review may be helpful in accelerating the COVID-19 booster dose
               vaccination.",
